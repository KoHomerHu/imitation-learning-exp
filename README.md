# imitation-learning-exp

An experiment of behavioral cloning and imitation learning on the highway-env.

## To-do List

- [ ] Implement a customized PyTorch dataset to load and sample trajectories
- [ ] Read the [deep sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06114.pdf) paper and implement it
- [ ] Collect data of manual control and dump it into a pickle file
- [ ] Experiment on behavioral cloning
- [ ] Experiment on GAIL
- [ ] Read the [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) paper and see if any improvement can be done
- [ ] Incorporate GRU / LSTM into GAIL
